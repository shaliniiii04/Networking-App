R-Junta Connect is an intra institute networking app. We've created an app that can give you information about various campus clubs to explore along with the contact details of the members to provide an advantage of connecting with them and clearing all queries especially for the first yearites.
We've provided the basic frontend of the app, where you can click on the drawer which displays options like "Explore clubs", "Networking", "student profile", from where you can explore the clubs and find the phone numbers of the members of the respective clubs.
